Input Files:
studentTable.txt
facultyTable.txt
(both files contain no spaces or empty lines)

Errors:
Runtime error with student and faculty printing (had to print on seperate lines instead of one block but still works!)
Kind of confused on rollback -- user has to input whether it is a faculty or student rollback (still works though)
